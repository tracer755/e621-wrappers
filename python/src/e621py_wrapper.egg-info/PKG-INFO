```python
client.posts.search(tags, blacklist, limit, page, ignorepage)
```

Tags is the input tags eg: "wickerbeast rating:e" if more than 1 tag is input sepereate the tags by a space

Blacklist is the same as tags but the wrapper will ignore these tags eg: rating:e will get rid of explicit results

Limit the ammount of posts returned if Limit is -1 unlimited posts are returned

Page page number to start at unless ignorepage is equal to False in which case it will only get posts from the input page


The only required data to passed into the function id tags

```python
client.posts.search("wickerbeast", "rating:e", 1, 1, False)
```

(All example returns are going to be in paset bin because they are big)
